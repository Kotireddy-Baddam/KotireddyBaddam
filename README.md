### A small shift, done deliberately

For a long time, my ideas lived in fragments —  
quick chats, scattered notes, half-formed thoughts between social posts and updates.

This space is me choosing to slow that down.

To move from short conversations to things I can revisit.  
From consuming to building.  
From temporary thoughts to something that leaves a trace.

I’m exploring data engineering — not as a checklist of tools,  
but as a way of understanding how data flows, evolves, and quietly shapes decisions.

This repository is where I plan to document that journey, as it happens.  
No polish, no rush. Just progress, recorded honestly.

If I find my way back here later,  
I want this to remind me why I began.
